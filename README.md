This script will allow to select an area of your screen, take a screenshot, upload it to an FTP server, and then open the screenshot in firefox.

Of course you'll need to configure the FTP settings such that the storage area is web-accessible.

I have the script set up as a keyboard shortcut.

Requires:

xsnap (http://freecode.com/projects/xsnap)
ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
